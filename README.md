##  2. User Experience
User experience is one of the most significant things when building a webpage. To do this properly, you should consider:
* who is your target audience,
* what they want to achieve by visiting your page,
* which features will meet their expectations.

In this case, potential customers are:

### User stories

As a potential visitor (first time visitor) I would like to:

    + return to home page when logo is clicked,
    + open desired subpages (login/home etc) in main nav,
    + open in new window all links inserted into the footer/navbar,

### Features
#### Global
#### Home page
### Information Architecture
#### Database choice

[MongoDB]() is a NoSQL, document-based database which groups data as key-value pairs within documents grouped into collections. MongoDB excels at storing and providing access to unstructured data at scale. MongoDB Atlas is the cloud hosted service used for this application.

#### Database collections structure

##### Employees collection

Collection name: employees

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ID | _id | None | `ObjectId` | Primary Key, unique, not null |
| First Name | first_name | `text`, `maxlength=100`, `required` | `String` | not null  |
| Last Name | last_name | `text`, `maxlength=100`, `required` | `String` | not null  |
| Provisions IDs | provisions_ids | None | `Array` | Array of ObjectIds ref: > provisions._id |
| Other Information | other_info | `textarea`, `max_length=5000` | `String` | |

note:
* use a different key other than default ObjectId for employee id?
* include age, gender, job_title fields?
